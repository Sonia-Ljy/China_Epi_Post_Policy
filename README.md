# China_Epi_Post_Policy

This project aims to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and the putative transmission routes in China after the termination of the dynamic zero-COVID policy. The main analysis workflow is documented in the "0_code" directory, where scripts are organized in numerical order for sequential execution. Each directory contains detailed analysis results and visualizations
